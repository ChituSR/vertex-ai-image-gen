Parse cli_gcp.py and determine if the README.md file needs to be updated. Only make changes for the CLI GCP
options and make sure that their usage, description, and default values are up to date. Be sure to
that the general structure of the README.md file is not changed and that the only changes made
are to the CLI GCP options.

Write the changes to README.md file if necessary.
